          <h3>About Myself</h3>
          <p>
            I am Japanese who love exlording and trying to new things. I had
            lived in Canada when I was 18 for 18 month. I earned money myself to
            oversee and learned English and touched different cultures. I
            constantly think what is life and what I need to feel successful of
            my life. I sort of figure out that answer that finding something
            passion about, and keep going on with the stuff, and being honest to
            yourself rather than what people think of you. That experience was
            more value than money and I was glad to feel it in my young age.
            Later on, after went back to japan, and went to Denmark, and Sweden.
            Eventually I figure out that I love coding. I am enjoying coding and
            can learn new things all the time since IT will develop all the
            time.I studied UX design through Online platform called Cousera and
            got into more about Front End Development. It is so excited to make
            website by coding and can develop many things as using more code
            such as JavaScript. I finished my Back End course in h√∂hskole. In
            the future, I would like to be ful-stack developer,but I would like
            to export Front end Devepolemnt
